(b) Human eye percieve color with the help of the cones wich are packed in Fovea.
Acromatic light is percieved by Rods and is characterized by the intensity of light. It varies from black light to white. The intermediate level is gray.
Chromatic light is percieved by the cones and is charaterized by 3 quantities:
1. Radiance is a total amount of energy emmited by a source of light [watts]
2. Liminace is a measure of the amount of energy that an observer perceives from the light source. We can consider it as filtered by the HVS
3. 3. Brigtness is a subjective evaluation what is the source of radiation we talk about.
